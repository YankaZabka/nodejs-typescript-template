# Typescript Node.js Project Template

This is a template project for starting a new TypeScript-based Node.js project. 
The project is pre-configured to use [TypeScript 5.0.2](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/), 
and includes a comprehensive set of development tools, such as [ESLint 8.37.0](https://eslint.org/docs/), 
[Prettier 2.8.7](https://prettier.io/docs/en/), and [nodemon 2.0.22](https://nodemon.io/), for linting, code formatting, and hot-reloading during development. 
The project also includes [Vitest 0.29.8](https://vitest.dev/) for testing, with pre-configured scripts for running tests and checking code style. 
Additionally, the project includes several useful development dependencies, such as [rimraf 4.4.1](https://github.com/isaacs/rimraf) for cleaning the `dist` directory
 and [ts-node 10.9.1](https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-node) for running TypeScript files directly. 
Finally, the project includes pre-commit hooks using [Husky 4.2.5](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/) to automatically run `lint-staged` on staged files 
and enforce conventional commit messages using [commitlint 17.5.1](https://commitlint.js.org/).

With this template project, you can quickly start a new TypeScript-based Node.js project with a robust set of development tools and best practices pre-configured.
